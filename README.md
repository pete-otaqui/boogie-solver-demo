# Boogie Solver Demo

This project is a demonstration of consuming the
[Boogie Solver](https://npmjs.com/package/boogie-solver) npm package (also see
the [Boogie Solver source](https://github.com/pete-otaqui/boogie-solver))

The project is built with Typescript, to show that Boogie Solver itself comes
with declarations for all functions and types.

The following scripts are included:

- `npm run build` - compile the project to `/build/index.js`
- `npm run demo` - run the compiled javascript
- `npm run demo:typescript` - run the source Typescript via `ts-node`
